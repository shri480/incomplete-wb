                        The Electrex planer delivers power and cutting capacity with ease of use. Durable and built to last,
                        it provides a smooth, even finish in the hardest of woods. The planer is designed in a manner, which
                        directs the sawdust away from the operator hence further increasing ease of operation. The
                        ergonomically designed handle provides greater comfort and less user fatigue.
